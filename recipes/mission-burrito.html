    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ul id="steps">
        <li>Carne Asada
            <ol>
                <li>If necessary, slice flank steak so it is no thicker than 1/2 inch.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together canola oil, lime juice, vinegar, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and salt.</li>
                <li>Put flank steak in a large freezer bag, then pour in oil mixture and massage into meat with your hands until it is well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add diced jalapeño with thinly sliced orange and white onion to bag (I used a mandolin to get them extra thin) and mix well.</li>
                <li>Seal bag and marinate in refrigerator 3 to 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>When steak has finished marinating, remove from bag, pat dry, and discard your marinate.</li>
                <li>In a large cast iron skillet, heat 2 or 3 TBS of oil on high heat and cook while searing on both sides for about 3 minutes per side (this can also be done on a grill).</li>
                <li>Let meat rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing against the grain, then continue to cut into whatever sized bit sized pieces you want in your burrito (I usually make them about 2 inches in length).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Mexican Rice
            <ol>
                <li>Using a food processor or immersion blender, blend 1/4 cup water, onion, garlic clove, and tomato paste, then set aside.</li>
                <li>In a thick pan or skillet, heat oil over medium heat, then pour in rice.</li>
                <li>Stir rice constantly until well coated in oil and toasted (takes about 3 to 5 minutes  - you will smell and see the rice toasting - careful not to burn).</li>
                <li>Once rice is toasted, put in your tomato paste mix and stir in until well incorporated in the rice and the water is all evaporated (takes about 30 to 60 seconds).</li>
                <li>Place in 1 ½ cups water with bullion powder and bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 20 minutes remove from heat, uncover rice and fluff it, then re-cover and let sit additional 10 minutes to finish.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Stewed Beans
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse your beans wells, then place in a pot and cover with broth and cold water.</li>
                <li>Add in all ingredients, stir well, then bring pot to a boil over high heat.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, simmer beans on low for 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove garlic and bay leaf.</li>
                <li>Taste and add salt if needed.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Pico de Gallo
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, mix diced tomatoes, onion, lime juice, cilantro, hot pepper, and salt. Enjoy any leftovers with tortilla chips.<li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Salsa Verde
            <ol>
                <li>On a parchment paper lined baking sheet, place tomatillos, onion, garlic, and serrano pepper, drizzle with a bit of oil, then place in 450°F oven for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes, toss all vegetables and bake for additional 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a food processor or blender, place all roasted ingredients, 1 tsp of salt, and the juice of half your lime, then blend.</li>
                <li>Once done, taste and add more salt and/or lime juice as you see fit.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Burrito Assembly</h4>
    <ol id="steps">
      <li>Steam your tortilla for 1 minute to soften.</li>
      <li>In the center of your tortilla spread a layer of cheese in a rectangular fashion (leaving rooms on sides to fold in and roll over into a burrito).</li>
      <li>On top of cheese add carne asada (you should be using ⅓ to ½ lb of meat but this will vary to your preference and tortilla size), then pico de gallo, then salsa verde, then a layer of rice, followed by a layer of beans (drained), and finally a few avocado slices.</li>
      <li>Starting on the short ends of your assembled ingredients rectangle, fold sides in over the top edge of your fillings, then bring up other tortilla end and roll over and tuck to form your burrito.</li>
      <li>To finish, you really should sear your assembled burrito on both sides in a cast iron or large skillet to keep it from falling apart while enjoying. However, you can skip this step by wrapping it in aluminum foil and unwrapping it as you eat.</li>
    </ol>
